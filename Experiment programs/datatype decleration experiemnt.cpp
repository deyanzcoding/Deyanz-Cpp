RULES FOR VARIABLE NAMEING::
   
   -->start from alphabets or underscore(_).
   -->not start from digits. (1,2,3....)
   -->only _ and $ special characters can be use for variable naming.
   -->blank_spaces are not allowed.
   -->digit can be use in between alphabets.
   -->can't use reserved keywords like (int,float,class..), but if we write in upper case then it is right. like (int INT,FLOAT,CHAR..)
   -->can't use same name for more then 1 variable.
   -->variable can be declare same name by differencing lower & upper case. like (int apple, Apple)
